                            <p>In 2013, change loomed large on the horizon. With the recent approval of interventional radiology as a primary specialty, plans were underway to create new educational pathways into the field. Passage of the Affordable Care Act a few years earlier, as well as efforts to replace the sustainable growth rate, pointed to significant changes for health care economics and reimbursement.</p>

                            <p>These changes were coming at a time of unprecedented growth for SIR and SIR Foundation. Membership, meeting registration and submission, JVIR impact factor, and other key metrics climbed ever higher with each passing year. It was increasingly clear that the IR community relied on SIR and SIR Foundation to help meet the changes that were quickly approaching and to formulate a plan that would ensure the specialty would not only survive but thrive.</p>

                            <p>The 2013–2017 Strategic Plan outlined steps that would position the society, foundation and SIR members for success, even in times of tremendous uncertainty. The final plan did just that—from developing a strong infrastructure to support the collection of outcomes data; to communicating the story of interventional radiology to decision-makers, referring physicians and other key stakeholders; to helping ensure that its members receive the training they need to remain a key part of the health care team and provide high-quality patient care.</p>

                            <p>As our plan draws to a close, we dedicated this year’s SIR and SIR Foundation annual report to the significant steps forward taken in the past four years.</p>

                            <h4 class="box-title">MACRA Matters campaign prepares IRs for new payment models</h4>

                            <p>SIR’s quality experts have been laser-focused preparing interventional radiologists for the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), a radical change to how physicians will be paid in the future.</p>

                            <aside class="sidebar boxed alignright">
                                <p><b>Advocacy in action:</b> SIR government affairs volunteers and staff stayed abreast of MACRA’s development, keeping members informed every step of the way [LINK to MACRA Matters page]. “SGR repeal had been on the minds of many physicians,” said Will Alago, MD, an at-large member of the SIR Political Action Committee (SIRPAC) board of directors and a member of the SIR Government Affairs Committee. “It was important that we keep members informed of what was coming—and aware that we were working on their behalf.”</p>
                            </aside>

                            <p>MACRA took effect Jan. 1, 2017, changing Medicare from a volume-based system (the sustainable growth rate or SGR) to a value-based system. MACRA includes a new Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and provides incentives for physicians to participate in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations and patient-centered medical homes.</p>

                            <p>SIR has developed several resources and programs that will help IRs maximize their reimbursement in the most efficient way possible. Taken together, these resources provide a pathway toward improved quality, value, research and patient care.</p>

                            <p>Developed in partnership with the American College of Radiology (ACR) and hosted by ACR, the IR National Quality Registry enables MIPS reporting and, as a Qualified Clinical Data Registry, allows the specification of non-MIPS performance measures. Beyond MIPS reporting, data collected in the IR Registry will be used to discover which IR procedures and systems are most effective and valuable for patients.</p>

                            <p>SIR has also created a new collection of structured reports that make it easier to collect performance data needed for MIPS and streamline the collection of data for the IR Registry, while supporting the specialty’s efforts to improve patient care. The reports can replace the narrative-based clinical reports IRs currently use. Seventeen reports have been tested and revised. Several other reports are under development. The reports are available for free to society members on the SIR website in XML and RTF formats for importing into voice recognition dictation systems.</p>

                            <p>“Structured reporting can help us tailor treatments to patients in the future and can help us determine whether standards are being met for certain outcome measures at different institutions,” said Rajesh Shah, MD, co-chair of the SIR Standardized Reporting Subcommittee.</p>

                            <p>In addition to powering MIPS reporting to CMS, the IR Registry will send quarterly reports regarding performance metrics to participating institutions and provide benchmark information on how they perform compared to other institutions.</p>

                            <p>“This allows individual sites to drive quality improvement projects to improve their performance,” said Jeremy D. Collins, MD, chair of the SIR Foundation Performance and Quality Improvement Division.</p>

                            <h5 class="box-sub-title">SIR-proposed performance measures adopted by CMS</h5>

                            <p>To make it easier for IRs to participate in the new performance-based payment system, SIR created and submitted 13 performance measures related to interventional radiology to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2014. Five were accepted and are currently available and will carry over into the MACRA system. SIR drafted 22 measures for inclusion in the 2017 program and 13 for the 2018 program. These measures are currently under preliminary review by CMS.</p>

                            <p>CMS is revising its strategy for acceptance of new measures, aligning the measures development process with the reporting years under the MIPS program. SIR is tuned in to any developments but faces a new challenge to ongoing performance measure development: CMS no longer accepts claims-based measures, requiring outcomes-based measures instead. This makes the process of collecting data through the standardized reports and the IR Registry all the more important.</p>

                            <p>“You have to have reasonable measures that target outcomes, which are sometimes harder than process measures to develop and quantify,” Dr. Collins explained.</p>

                            <p>MACRA also requires that proposed measures include a literature review that makes the case for need and illustrates that the data can’t be collected through any existing measure, Dr. Collins said.</p>

                            <p>Under the system, CMS’s priority is to improve the quality of health care, which is “why we’re moving in the direction of outcome measures,” said Sophia Autrey, MPH, CHES, a social science research analyst at CMS. “More and more, we find that, while process measures are important for physicians, they do not contribute to improved quality health care.”</p>

                            <p>As CMS evaluates proposed performance measures, it looks for several elements: Whether the measure is relevant to the stakeholders (physicians and patients), whether there is a performance gap and whether the measure will lead to improved quality, Autrey said.</p>

                            <p>As specialty societies develop proposed measures, it is important that they collaborate with CMS from the start, as SIR did, Autrey said. “From our perspective, it’s very helpful, especially when we’re involved early in the process. We can go through their concept with them and help identify gaps … and help them tweak the measures.”</p>

                            <h4 class="box-title">Face-to-face advocacy generates support</h4>

                            <p>As SIR continues to advocate for the specialty through face-to-face meetings, action alerts, phone calls and other efforts, it is important that IRs get involved. Legislators appreciate hearing directly from IRs—their constituents in the trenches. As interventional radiologists meet their representatives and senators face to face, they forge relationships that are critical to building support for IR issues now and in the future.</p>
 
                            <p>“The challenge is to put a face on interventional radiology and educate our legislators on who we are and what we do,” said Meridith Englander, MD, vice chair of the SIR Government Affairs Committee and SIR’s delegate to the American Medical Association. When visiting with lawmakers, Dr. Englander highlights IR procedures and points out how they help patients: faster recovery times, cost savings, preventing or staving off major surgeries and hospital stays.</p>
 
                            <p>“We want people to know who we are so that when we do have something big to ask for, we’re not an anomaly and they are aware of the value we add to the health care system,” Dr. Englander said.</p>
 
                            <p>Congressional staff members attest to the success of SIR efforts: “SIR is uniquely equipped to lend its expertise to members of Congress who need to understand how various public policy decisions would impact interventional radiologists,” said Mark Chenoweth, former chief of staff to Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan. “Without SIR’s insights, Congress might mistakenly support changes that would be detrimental to patients and providers.”</p>
 
                            <p>To get more IRs involved, SIR created the Grassroots Leadership Program, which celebrated its third class of participants in 2016. The program offers interested SIR members from across the country the opportunity to engage with their elected senators and representatives and key congressional staff about the policy issues that affect interventional radiologists.</p>
 
                            <p>Over two days in Washington, D.C., in May 2016, 15 SIR members met with lawmakers to share their expertise and put a human touch on decisions about interventional radiology. Beforehand, they took part in a four-hour advocacy boot camp to gain an overview of the advocacy process and understanding of key policy issues. They also participated in three SIRPAC events that hosted Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., John Shimkus, R-Ill., and Chris Collins, R-N.Y., who serve on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p>

                            <p>“SIR’s federal affairs representatives, and the doctors whom they brought to town, were among the brightest, most straightforward people I met,” Chenoweth said. “And they were the most capable of explaining complex ideas in simple terms that I encountered on Capitol Hill.”</p>
 
                            <p>While government affairs staff is dedicated to working on these issues every day, it is essential for legislators to hear about issues, challenges and solutions directly from interventional radiologists.</p>
 
                            <p>“We’re a little-known specialty, albeit rapidly growing and one of the more popular in medicine today, and our interests need to be represented on Capitol Hill,” Dr. Alago said. “To continue to celebrate the advances that IR has achieved as a specialty is quite important—as important as informing the people who are shaping health care policy so they know what we’ve done and what we continue to do to advance the interests of our patients.”</p>

                            <h4 class="box-title">SIR advocates for appropriate reimbursement with CMS</h4>

                            <p>In July 2016, when CMS published the proposed 2017 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule that governs Part B payments, the SIR Economics Committee went into action to avert a proposed blanket 7 percent reduction to IR services.</p>

                            <aside class="sidebar boxed alignright">
                                <p><b>Advocacy in action:</b> Text to come—a quote and possible video from a past president.</p>
                            </aside>

                            <p>After several weeks of analysis, SIR submitted comments to CMS, pointing out discrepancies in CMS's analysis, and gained back practice expense costs, as well as restore some of the physician work RVUs that had been cut. In response to SIR's comments, and coupled with new projected utilization data used by CMS, the final 2017 overall cut to IR was reduced to about 1 percent.</p>

                            <h4 class="box-title">Collaborating to strengthen IR</h4>

                            <p>As the new IR Residency is launched, first hundreds, and eventually thousands, of new physicians will be focused solely on IR as its own specialty. To prepare for this new model, SIR has been collaborating with ACR to develop tools and resources that will promote the clinical practice of interventional radiology.</p>

                            <p>“Because each organization has a different approach and a different thrust, both can be useful in helping interventional radiologists build and enhance their practice,” said Kenneth W. Chin, MD, FSIR, a member of the ACR Interventional Radiology and Interventional Neuroradiology Task Force. Dr. Chin is an interventional radiologist and was a longtime liaison between the two organizations.</p>

                            <p>The task force was created in 2013 and completed its work in 2016, creating resources in three areas—education, clinical practice and communications. A part of ACR Imaging 3.0, these resources are co-branded and mutually beneficial to both organizations.</p>

                            <p>“With integration within the two specialties, it’s very helpful to have a high-powered diagnostic group affiliated with a high-powered interventional radiology group because one will often let the other know of issues or practices or opportunities,” said Philip S. Cook, MD, FSIR, chair of the task force and chair of the ACR Commission on Interventional and Cardiovascular Radiology. “We need to find ways to overcome any traditional or older boundaries between how diagnostic radiologists and interventional radiologists practiced in the past.”</p>

                            <h4 class="box-title">SIR details new residency path for the next generation of IRs</h4>

                            <p>On Match Day, March 18, 2016, four years after the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) recognized interventional radiology as a distinct medical specialty, thousands of nervous and excited medical students across the United States were about to learn if they matched with their dream residency program, whether that was in pediatrics, dermatology, cardiology or, now, interventional radiology.</p>

                            <p>And, on that day, 15 students made history, becoming the first class of interventional radiology residents, matching at seven newly minted IR residency programs. In 2017, that number will increase significantly as 61 programs are now ABMS accredited with approximately 120 available positions.</p>

                            <p>“It’s been incredibly rewarding to see the IR education community step up in such a strong way to the challenges of radical change in training,” said M. Victoria (Vicki) Marx, MD, FSIR, SIR secretary, former chair of the IR Residency Task Force and associate director of the IR residency program at the University of Southern California (USC).</p>

                            <p>Students’ interest appears to be enormous. Dr. Marx said USC applications for its inaugural match year in 2017 have far exceeded the number of positions. At the Medical College of Wisconsin, approximately 275 applications had been received with six weeks still to go before the deadline—for only two available positions, said Parag J. Patel, MD, MS, FSIR, associate professor of radiology and councilor of the SIR Graduate Medical Education Division.</p>

                            <p>The popularity of the IR Residency in just its first year shows both the need for the specialty and the interest among future physicians. Thanks to SIR’s vigorous education and awareness campaigns aimed at medical students—as well as the creation of IR interest groups at medical schools and regional IR symposiums for med students—students have been developing an excitement for IR. They have become passionate about building a medical career that will allow them to become experts in imaging and perform image-guided procedures, all while providing ongoing care for their patients.</p>

                            <aside class="sidebar boxed alignright">
                                <p><b>Advocacy in action:</b> SIR continues to call for increased graduate medical education funding and supports a bill, “Enhancing Opportunities for Medical Doctors Act,” introduced in May 2016 by Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah. The bill would reallocate existing, but historically unused, government-funded slots to specialties recently elevated to the “primary specialty” designation—such as interventional radiology—as well as to rural institutions and new medical schools. SIR will continue to build support for the bill, which has both Democrat and Republican co-sponsors.</p>
                            </aside>

                            <p>Instead of focusing four years on diagnostic radiology, followed by a one-year fellowship, integrated IR residents will now spend those five years integrating diagnostic and interventional radiology and clinical care. The number of procedures they were required to perform in fellowship—a minimum of 500—will double to 1,000. Another residency option, the “independent residency,” will allow a resident who completes a four-year diagnostic radiology residency to follow it up with two years of IR training. This is an option for those who don’t initially match into IR or DR residents who decide partway through residency they want to become interventional radiologists.</p>

                            <p>Beyond the longer IR program and the heightened focus on clinical care, the new residency allows for plenty of room for innovation, which can lead to better patient care, said Dr. Patel.</p>

                            <p>“Different training programs provide exposure to innovative therapies or research experiences at their institutions, and a trainee now has five years to commit to being involved in some of those efforts,” he said. “I think the opportunity to spend five years with a trainee, who can then be involved more meaningfully in research or problem-solving for patients, can only benefit our specialty.”</p>

                            <p>In only its first two years, 85 percent of SIR members have logged in. This 24/7 community can be helpful for those working at smaller institutions where they are the sole IR, for younger IRs looking for career advice and for those seeking expert opinions from peers on a difficult or perplexing case or procedure.</p>

                            <p>As participants build discussions and share information, they help each other improve patient care and clinical practice at the ground level. Initial queries and advice have led to ongoing mentorships and new relationships among IRs.</p>

                            <p>The future of interventional radiology will combine data collection, registries and research to improve and develop new procedures and treatment options, said Raj Pyne, MD, secretary of SIR’s Early Career Section and an IR in private practice at Rochester General Hospital and medical director of The Vein Institute in Rochester, N.Y. “I think the only way you can do that is if you have collaboration, and the only way to have collaboration is if you are networked with other people,” he says.</p>

                            <p>That collaboration started in earnest two years ago with the creation of the Early Career Section, which is for interventional radiologists in their first eight years of practice out of fellowship. The section was a way to bridge the gap between the Resident, Fellow and Student Section (RFS) and more senior attendings.</p>

                            <aside class="sidebar boxed alignright">
                                <p><b>Advocacy in action:</b> SIR advocated on Capitol Hill for the 21st Century Cures Act, which became law in December 2016. The law provides new funding for the Food and Drug Administration, including grants to help states with high incidences of opioid abuse. It also provides funding for the National Institutes of Health, including money reserved for the Cancer Moonshot Initiative to accelerate cancer research.</p>
                            </aside>

                            <p>Within one year, the Early Career Section already had more than 150 members, serving the unique career and practice needs of this group through peer-to-peer development. “For a lot of the young IRs, you learn how to do procedures,” Dr. Pyne says, “but you don’t learn the business.”</p>

                            <p>The section’s webinar series this year has been wildly successful: 100+ people registered for the inaugural webinar on legislative changes to payment reform. ECS leadership anticipates that the webinars will connect its members with the latest on clinical and practice management topics year round.</p>

                            <p>To ease the transition of fellows-in-training and early-career members, the section successfully advocated for the creation of a membership discount for early-career IRs. Previously, fellows-in-training received a 50 percent discount on membership dues as they moved into the first-year membership category. The new rate offers an additional 20 percent reduction for the first two years. This offer will be time limited to encourage early renewal.</p>

                            <p>The section will continue to implement and advocate for programs that allow new IRs to network and work together as they build their clinical practices.</p>

                            <h4 class="box-title">Diversity expands as IR grows</h4>

                            <p>SIR’s Diversity and Inclusion Committee has launched several new programs to recruit more minority and female medical students into the specialty, recognizing the need for increased diversity.</p>

                            <p>Although 13 percent of the people in the United States are black or African American, they make up only 4 percent of the physician workforce, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). In addition, only 4 percent of doctors are Hispanic, 12 percent are Asian and 49 percent are white. Furthermore, IR is among the medical specialties with the least amount of gender or ethnic diversity when compared to gender and ethnic percentages of AAMC-certified medical schools and all ACGME-certified residencies and medical fellowships.</p>

                            <p>It is important that the diversity of the physician workforce mirror the diverse patient population, in part, because studies show that patients are more comfortable with doctors who look like them and whose backgrounds and cultural experiences are similar, said Derek L. West, MD, co-chair of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee.</p>

                            <p>The two-year-old committee has three subcommittees focusing on new efforts to recruit women and underrepresented minorities into the specialty:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>The Annual Scientific Meeting Subcommittee is examining ways to expand programming for and about women and underrepresented minorities and about overall diversity topics. The subcommittee also aims to increase the diversity of meeting presenters.</li>
                                <li>As SIR embarks on the development of its next five-year plan, the Strategic Plan Subcommittee is developing principles of diversity and inclusion.</li>
                                <li>Now that IR has its own residency program, the Outreach and Pipeline Subcommittee is creating programs to reach out directly to medical students about the benefits of becoming an interventional radiologist.</li>

                            <p>In fiscal 2015, the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) generated a positive operational bottom line with a total gain for the year of $397,282. Total revenues in 2015 was $8,968,141 which is $411,508 higher than what they were in 2014. The increase stemmed from corporate support and promotional opportunities related to the CAP program, increased revenue related to <em>JVIR</em> advertising royalty and editorial support and increased membership dues related to the 2014 dues increase. Total expenses in 2015 were $8,508,468, which is $77,978 higher than what they were in 2014. Functional areas which drove this increase were education, health policy and economics.</p>

                            <div class="chart-container" data-chart="sir_pie"></div>
                            
                            <p>The Society’s long-term investment portfolio resulted in a loss of 1.0 percent for the fiscal year 2015, and an additional $420k was withdrawn to support capital improvement projects. Investments total $6,123,355 on Dec. 31, 2015. The portfolio is invested in a number of equity and fixed-income mutual funds that is in line with the long-term objectives of capital appreciation for the portfolio.</p>

                            <p>SIR continues to maintain its strong financial position. As of Dec. 31, 2015, the society had assets of $9.8M and liabilities of $3.9M, with net assets of $5.9M. Net assets increased overall by $397k in fiscal year 2015 from the positive bottom line.</p>

                            <p>In fiscal 2015, the Society of Interventional Radiology Foundation generated a negative bottom line with a total loss for the year of $857,301. Total revenues in 2015 was $741,738 which is $426,793 lower than what they were in 2014. The foundation ended the solicitation phase of the Discovery Campaign in 2014, which accounts for a majority of the variance. Total expenses in 2015 were $1,599,039 which is $135,781 more than 2014. A majority of the increase is related to the grant program which awarded $493,721 in grant funding in 2015. This represents a 61 percent increase compared to the prior year.</p>

                            <div class="chart-container" data-chart="sir_fdn_pie"></div>

                            <p>The foundation’s long-term investment portfolio resulted in a loss of 1.12 percent for the fiscal year 2015, and investments totaled $4,510,833 on Dec. 31, 2015. The foundation's investment portfolio mirrors the SIR portfolio.</p>

                            <p>The foundation also continues to maintain its strong financial position. As of Dec. 31, 2015, the foundation had assets of $5.1M and liabilities of $978k, with net assets of $4.1M. Net assets decreased overall by $1M in fiscal year 2015 from the negative bottom line. This decrease was expected and is attributed to the pay-down of the Discovery Campaign pledges received between 2009 and 2015.</p>

                            <p>In fiscal 2015, the society continued work on two capital initiatives that are funded in part from the long-term reserves. These initiatives were the completion of the headquarter office infrastructure upgrade and the website redesign, which is targeted for completion by 4th quarter 2016. Along with these initiatives, over the past two years the society has invested in infrastructure that enhances the member experience and increases member engagement through a new payment and donation portal, easier access to online educational activities and the SIR Connect community platform.</p>

                            <p>In order to provide for ongoing financial stability, the appropriate level of funding for infrastructure projects and resources for future initiatives, the society has a target level for long-term investments of 50 percent of annual expenditures. As of Dec. 31, 2015, this percentage was 72 percent.</p>

                            <h4 class="box-title">Annual audit</h4>

                            <p>The society’s independent auditors, RAFFA, are in the process of completing the audit of the fiscal year 2015 consolidated financial statement in March 2016. Their report will be reviewed by the SIR Audit Committee during the annual meeting and will be on file at SIR headquarters in Fairfaix, Virginia.</p>
